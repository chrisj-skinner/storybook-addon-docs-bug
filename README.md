# Docs AddOn Bug Test

Run `npm run storybook:pass` to see the docs and a11y addon working together within storybook. This uses the default port of `6006`.

Run `npm run storybook:fail` to break / hide the a11y addon and all other addons used in the addon bar. This uses the suggested port of 9008 mentioned at [https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/addons/docs/angular#props-tables](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/addons/docs/angular#props-tables).
